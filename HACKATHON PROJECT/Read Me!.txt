How the rating system works ?

When a new doctor is added , the admin is also asked to enter a rating. The final rating that is shown to the patients is calculated from 
the default rating added by the admin and the rating given to that doctor by the patients in the review section

Python modules used: tkinter, mysql-connector-python

Import Squad thanks the organizers for this wonderful opportunity !!
